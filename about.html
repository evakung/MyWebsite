<div class="about_me" id="about_me">


My name is Eva, I am 24 years old and am a recent graduate from the University of Toronto (St. George) with a H.BSc in Computer Science (Specialist). I am working hard towards becoming a web designer. I am all about creativity and delivering the best of my skills for the public when it comes to design and development.

I am currently self studying Visual Basic, and brushing up a few other languages such as PHP SQL and JavaScript. I am also taking time out in learning with Adobe Suite programs such as Illustrator and Photoshop as well for self interest due to limited time/opportunities to do so during my undergrad studies.
